BLINKIT PYTHON STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - RESULTS SUMMARY

Author: Adeyemi Boluwatife
Analysis Tool: Python (Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn)
Date: October 2025
Dataset: 8,523 transactions


DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Sales Distribution:
Mean: $140.99
Median: $143.01
Standard Deviation: $62.28
Range: $31.29 - $266.89

The mean and median are almost identical, which tells us sales are evenly spread 
without extreme outliers pulling the average up or down. This is a healthy sign 
for the business.

Item Weight:
Mean: 12.86 kg
Median: 12.86 kg
Standard Deviation: 4.23 kg

Weight is perfectly centered. Most products fall within a manageable range for 
shelving and handling.

Item Visibility:
Mean: 6.61%
Median: 5.39%
Standard Deviation: 5.16%

Half of all items get less than 5.4% shelf visibility. That's pretty low. This 
could explain why some products underperform even when they're good quality.

Rating Distribution:
Mean: 3.97
Mode: 4.0 (39.2% of all ratings)
Range: 1.0 - 5.0

Customers are happy. Nearly 40% give a perfect 4.0 rating, and the average sits 
just below 4. Very few complaints in this dataset.

Outlet Establishment Year:
Range: 2011 - 2022
Most Common: 2018
Mean: 2016.45

2018 stands out as a big expansion year. Whatever strategy was used then might be 
worth replicating.


CORRELATION ANALYSIS

Sales vs Item Visibility:
r = -0.001, p = 0.903

Basically zero correlation. At first this seems weird because common sense says 
more visible items should sell more. But the relationship might not be linear. 
Maybe visibility only matters once you cross a certain threshold, like 10% or 15%.

Sales vs Item Weight:
r = 0.025, p = 0.022

Technically significant but the correlation is so weak it's almost meaningless. 
Heavier items sell a tiny bit more, but weight isn't a real driver of sales.

Sales vs Rating:
r = 0.011, p = 0.296

No relationship between rating and sales. This is actually surprising. You'd think 
highly rated products would fly off shelves, but that's not what the data shows. 
It suggests that marketing and placement matter way more than product quality alone.

Item Visibility vs Item Weight:
r = -0.011, p = 0.293

These two are completely independent. Good news for modeling because it means no 
multicollinearity issues if we use both in a regression.


CHI-SQUARE TESTS

Test 1: Fat Content vs Location Type
Chi-square = 0.123, p = 0.940

No relationship here. Customer preference for low-fat vs regular items is basically 
the same whether you're in Tier 1, 2, or 3 cities.

The breakdown:
Tier 1: 64.5% prefer low-fat
Tier 2: 65.0% prefer low-fat
Tier 3: 64.7% prefer low-fat

Almost identical. This makes inventory planning way easier because you can use the 
same 65/35 split everywhere.

Test 2: Item Type vs Outlet Type
Chi-square = 21.36, p = 0.999

Product categories are distributed evenly across outlet types. Supermarkets and 
grocery stores carry similar mixes of fruits, snacks, dairy, etc. No real 
specialization by format.


WHAT THE STATS ARE REALLY SAYING

The continuous variables (weight, visibility, rating) barely correlate with sales. 
This tells us something important: individual product features don't drive 
performance. It's the bigger picture stuff like which outlet you're in, what size 
it is, and where it's located.

Think of it this way: a great product with a 5-star rating still won't sell if 
it's in a poorly performing outlet with bad foot traffic. On the flip side, an 
average product in a prime location with good visibility will move units.


THE VISIBILITY PUZZLE

SQL analysis showed that high visibility items perform better. But the correlation 
here is flat. What gives?

The answer is probably that visibility works in categories, not on a smooth scale. 
Being at 3% vs 5% visibility might not matter much, but jumping from 5% to 15% 
could make a huge difference. It's a threshold effect, not a linear one.


QUALITY DOESN'T EQUAL SALES

The rating-sales disconnect is eye-opening. Products with 4.5+ ratings don't 
necessarily outsell 3.5-rated items. This means customers are buying what they see, 
not necessarily what's best. 

Takeaway: Better shelf placement beats better product quality when it comes to 
moving inventory.


STANDARDIZATION WORKS

Both chi-square tests came back with no significant differences. Customers in 
different cities want similar things. Different outlet formats stock similar 
products. This validates a one-size-fits-most approach.

You don't need custom strategies for each location or outlet type. Keep it simple 
and replicate what works.


BUSINESS IMPACT

Stop obsessing over product attributes. The weight of an item or its exact rating 
matters way less than where you put it and which outlet it's in.

Keep the 65/35 low-fat to regular split across all locations. No need to customize 
by tier.

Focus on outlet-level decisions. Type, size, and location are what really drive 
sales, not tweaking individual SKUs.

Investigate visibility thresholds. Find the magic number where visibility actually 
starts to impact sales. My guess is somewhere around 10-15%.

Marketing over quality. If a product has decent reviews (3.5+), invest in making 
it more visible rather than trying to improve it to 4.5+.


STATISTICAL METHODS USED

Pearson correlation for continuous variables
Chi-square test of independence for categorical relationships
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std dev)
Significance level: p < 0.05

All tests run in Python using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.


WHAT WE DIDN'T TEST

Regression modeling with all variables combined
ANOVA to compare mean sales across groups
Non-linear relationships or interaction effects
Time-based patterns or seasonal trends
Profitability analysis (only have revenue data)


HONEST LIMITATIONS

Correlation doesn't mean causation. Just because rating and sales aren't correlated 
doesn't mean ratings are useless. There could be hidden factors we're not seeing.

We only looked at linear relationships. More complex patterns might exist.

No customer demographic data. We can't segment by age, income, family size, etc.

Cross-sectional analysis only. We're looking at a snapshot, not tracking changes 
over time.


THE BOTTOM LINE

Your sales are driven by where you sell and how you present products, not by the 
products themselves. This is good news because outlet location and format are 
strategic decisions you can control.

The data supports keeping operations standardized. Same product mix, same ratios, 
replicate successful outlet formats. Don't overcomplicate it.

The one area to dig deeper is visibility. There's likely a sweet spot where 
increasing visibility actually pays off. Find that threshold and make sure every 
product hits it.
